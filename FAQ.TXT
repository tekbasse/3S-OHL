Q: Why is IMG_2967.JPG so blurry and uncompressed?

A: This is a copy of the original, unedited file from the digital camera
   that took the photograph. It's blurry because the three second exposure
   with wide aperature shortened the depth of field.


Q: This isn't a complete product. Why did you publish it now?

A: The design has reached a level where it has the potential for 
   open hardware practitioners and DIYers to make impressive
   innovations with it.  It is released under an open hardware
   license in part to prevent patent restrictions from potentially
   foiling rapid advance of a new generation of technology.
