Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Why is content in unreadable file formats and unrecognized file extensions?

A: Content is published in a variety of standard formats:

  file suffix     format type
  .gif            Graphical Interchange Format File
  .html           Web page readable by internet browsers
  .JPG            A graphics image format readable by internet browsers
  .md             Markdown file format ie. a text format 
                    that renders well in html converters
  .odt            OpenDocument text format. Can't read? Try LibreOffice 
  .odg            OpenDocument graphics format. Can't read? Try LibreOffice
  .TXT            Text file

Q: Why is IMG_2967.JPG so blurry and uncompressed?

A: This is a copy of the original, unedited file from the digital camera
   that took the photograph. It's blurry because the three second exposure
   with wide aperature shortened the depth of field.


Q: This isn't a complete product. Why did you publish it now?

A: The design has reached a level where it has the potential for 
   open hardware practitioners and DIYers to make impressive
   innovations with it.  It is released under an open hardware
   license in part to prevent patent restrictions from potentially
   foiling rapid advance of a new generation of technology.


Q: Why call this a synchrotron?
   This isn't a synchrotron that's used in high-energy physics,
   where a synchrotron is larger than most buildings and 
   uses lots of electricity to accelerate electrons
   in a vacuum and guided by magnetic fields.
   
A: At the moment, "solid-state synchrotron" seems to be the best fit,
   but you're welcome to call it something else; and I will gladly
   consider alternate names. The device is driven by and accelerates
   electrons in fixed, spiraling paths. All other names I came up 
   with turned out to represent other things much less related. Since
   there are different types of synchrotrons, and no solid-state
   synchrotron is defined, this seems to work for now. A general
   definition of manufactured synchrotron devices can be found at
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchrotron_light_source
   Natural sources of synchrotron radiation exist also. For a list,
   see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_light_sources
