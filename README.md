Abstract
========

This hardware design is a solid-state synchrotron that multiplies an input voltage with each resonating cycle, and is capable of emitting electromagnetic waves at specific sets of frequencies and may emit plasma from a cascade of alternating EM flux. Speculatively, this device has the potential to meet multiple, fundamental target technology design challenges.

See file: README.odt for details.
